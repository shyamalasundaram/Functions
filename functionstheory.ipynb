        "# **Question 10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Python's map(), filter(), and reduce() are powerful tools from the functional programming paradigm that allow you to process iterables (like lists, tuples, etc.) in a concise and efficient way, without explicitly writing loops.\n",
        "  * They are often used with lambda functions for brevity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of their differences:\n",
        "# **1. map() (transformation)**:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose:**\n",
        "  *  Applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns a new iterable (a map object) containing the transformed items.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Function Signature:**\n",
        "  *  map(function, iterable, ...).\n",
        "**Output:**\n",
        "  *  An iterable (map object) with the same number of elements as the input iterable(s).\n",
        "**Use Case:** Transforming each element in a collection individually, such as squaring all numbers in a list or converting strings to uppercase.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "     numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",

        "\n",
        "**Purpose:**\n",
        "  * Filters elements from an iterable based on a function that returns a boolean (True or False) and returns a new iterable (filter object) containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.\n",
        "**Function Signature:**\n",

        "Note: reduce() is not a built-in function in Python 3; it needs to be imported from the functools module.\n",
